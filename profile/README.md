## Overview
Agnirath Aerolabs is a deep-tech defence company headquartered in India, committed to advancing indigenous capabilities in autonomous systems across land, air, and maritime domains. Founded by a team of engineers and professionals with strong defence backgrounds, Agnirath emerged in response to the urgent need for modern ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) platforms—ones that are real-time, autonomous, and resilient enough to operate effectively in today’s rapidly evolving combat environments.

Our systems are designed and developed with over 70% indigenous components, aligning with the Government of India’s IDDM (Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured) policy. Every platform is mission-focused and tailored to meet the operational requirements of modern warfare with precision, agility, and reliability.

At Agnirath Aerolabs , we are dedicated to building the next generation of defence technologies that empower our armed forces with actionable intelligence at the speed of battle.
